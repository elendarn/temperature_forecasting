## Short-Term Temperature Forecasting for Berlin-Tempelhof

This project focuses on creating a short-term temperature forecast for Berlin-Tempelhof. The goal is to develop a reliable model that accurately predicts the temperature based on historical data. The following steps will be undertaken:

1. **Data Collection and Cleaning**: Temperature data will be obtained from www.ecad.eu and processed to ensure its quality and consistency.

2. **Baseline Model Development**: A baseline model will be constructed to capture the trend and seasonality patterns in the temperature data. This model will serve as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of more advanced models.

3. **AR Model Implementation**: Autoregressive (AR) models will be employed to model the time dependence of the remaining temperature variations after accounting for trend and seasonality. Several AR models with varying lag orders will be considered.

4. **Statistical Comparison**: The output of different AR models will be compared using statistical metrics to assess their accuracy and predictive power. This analysis will help identify the most suitable AR model for short-term temperature forecasting.

By completing this project, we aim to provide a reliable temperature forecasting solution for Berlin-Tempelhof, enabling better planning and decision-making in various sectors that are sensitive to temperature changes. The project code and results will be shared on GitHub, facilitating collaboration and knowledge sharing among the data science community.
